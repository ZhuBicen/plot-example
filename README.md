This repo is used to reproduce and Fix QCustomPlot(Version: 2.1.1, released on November 6, 2022) bugs
The QCustomPlot official release is just including qcustomplot.h and qcustomplot.cpp. it is user friendly to use, but not friendly to read.
I use the split.py split each class to standalone .h and .cpp file, it is located in src. so we can easy to navigate and focus on each class.
